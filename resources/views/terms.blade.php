        <p ><span >Subject to Section 25, we do not operate an escrow service in relation to the Website. Yohli separately owns and operates a business known as Escrow.com - for the avoidance of doubt this business is separate and there is no connection between terms, conditions, products and services offered on Yohli and services offered on Escrow.com. We do, however, provide a service on this Website which allows controlled payments to be made with respect to a service, called Milestone Payments.</span></p>
        <p ><span >Subject to the User Contract, the Buyer can make a Milestone Payment subject to Section 25, which will be locked from the Buyer's Account and cannot be claimed by the Seller until:</span></p>

        <ol>
            <li><span >the Buyer and Seller agree that the funds can be claimed by the Seller;</span></li>

        <p ><span >In the state of California, United States of America, Milestone Payments are regarded as regulated escrow activity.</span></p>
        <p ><span >This Section deals with and applies to Milestone Payments that are connected to California, i.e. where a User, being a Buyer or a Seller, is ordinarily resident in California, United States of America (“California User” or “California Users”).</span></p>
        <p ><span >So that we can continue to serve our California Users, Escrow.com (a business owned and separately operated by Yohli) will facilitate escrow transactions on behalf of a Buyer and/or Seller either of whom is a California User, and to hold the funds in relation to any Project. Until further notice, there will be no additional Fees for facilitating an escrow transaction initiated as a result of this Section.</span></p>
        <p ><span >Where a California User is a Buyer or Seller in relation to any Project, and a Buyer seeks to initiate a Milestone Payment, the Users will be directed to complete Milestone Payments through Escrow.com as a Transaction (‘California Transaction”) in accordance with the Escrow.com Terms of Use and General Escrow Instructions.</span></p>
        <p ><span >The Escrow.com Group includes Escrow.com Inc. and Internet Escrow Services, Inc (“IES”) which are owned and operated by a wholly owned subsidiary in the Yohli Group. IES is a licensed Escrow Agent in the state of California holding Escrow Agent License No. 9631867, issued by the California Department of Business Oversight. As part of using the Escrow.com service you authorize Yohli to share your information with the Escrow.com Group to complete Escrow.com’s identity verification and know your customer procedures.</span></p>
        <p ><span >On completion of the work related to the Milestone Payment, the Seller will direct IES to disburse the proceeds of the Escrow.com Transaction to the User’s Account with Yohli.</span></p>
        <p ><span ><b>MIGHT REMOVE THE BELOW: </b></span></p>
        <p ><span ><b>Accepted Currencies for Milestone Payments and California Users</b></span></p>
        <p ><span >Escrow.com currently supports Transactions in three currencies; U.S. Dollars, Ghana Cedis and Canadian Dollars (“Supported Currencies”). If a Buyer's Payment Method is denominated in a currency other than the supported currencies, a currency conversion will be required for the Milestone Payment to be made and an Escrow.com Transaction to proceed. We will display foreign currency conversion rates that Yohli, Escrow, or our Affiliates currently make available to convert supported foreign currencies to one of the Supported Currencies.</span></p>
        <p ><span >These foreign currency conversion rates adjust regularly based on market conditions. Wholesale currency conversion rates at which Yohli or our Affiliates obtain foreign currency will usually be different than the foreign currency conversion rates offered on the Site. Each User, in its sole discretion and risk, may authorize the charge, debit, or credit of its Payment Method in a supported foreign currency and the conversion of the payment to one of the supported currencies at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site. A list of supported foreign currencies is available on the Site. If foreign currency conversion is required to make a payment in one of the Supported Currencies and either Yohli, Escrow, or our Affiliates does not support the foreign currency or the User does not authorize the conversion of such payment at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site, Escrow or one of our Affiliates will charge, debit, or credit the User's Payment Method and the User's Payment Method provider will convert the payment at a foreign currency conversion rate selected by the User's Payment Method provider. The User's Payment Method provider may also charge fees directly to the Payment Method even when no currency conversion is involved. The User's authorization of a payment using a foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site is at the User's sole risk. Yohli, Escrow, and our Affiliates are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when billing or crediting a Payment Method denominated in a currency other than one of the Supported Currencies. Yohli, Escrow, and our Affiliates are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when receiving or sending payments to and from the Escrow Account.</span></p>

        <p ><span >Buyers and Sellers in a California Transaction irrevocably authorize and instruct IES to release applicable portions of the Milestone Payment in an Escrow Account (each portion, a “Release”) to their Seller Escrow Account or in the event of a refund, the Buyer Escrow Account, as applicable, upon the occurrence of and in accordance with one or more Release Conditions provided below or as otherwise required by applicable law or the Terms of Service. The amount of any Release will be delivered to the applicable Yohli Account in accordance with Seller’s or Buyer’s authorization, as above, these Instructions, and the IES Terms of Service and General Escrow Instructions.</span></p>
        <p ><span >As used in these Instructions, “Release Condition” means any of the following:</span></p>
